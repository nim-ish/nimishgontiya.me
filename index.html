                <h3>Video-based Traffic Optimization (January 2021 - May 2021)</h3>
        <p>
            A final-year project in a group of four, this project aimed to use video feed from traffic cameras to
            organize traffic better by changing the lights based on the load of traffic on each side.
            Used open-CV Python implementation for detecting traffic vehicles in real-time.
            Designed the algorithm to calculate the amount of time in which the traffic signal should stay in a particular
            state, which increases the traffic flow by 15%.</p>
